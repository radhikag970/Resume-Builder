Resume building can sometimes be very complicated process.Using the website one can build quick resume by just providing 
all the required information and can even skip a component for example if a fresher has no work experience then he/she 
can just leave the portion blank and it will not appear in the resume.
The Resume Builder websites has two main sections:
The Editor- This component takes input from the user.It has 6 components to take input.
a-Basic Info
